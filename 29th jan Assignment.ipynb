    "Q1.who developed python progrmming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans- python progrmming language was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s while he was working at the centrum Wiskude & Information (CWI) in the Netherlands. the initial version of python ,was released on February 20, 1991. Since then, Guido van Rossum has been the primary author of Python, leading its development and evolution as an open-source programming language. Today, Python is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, with a vibrant community of developers and users. "

    "ans-In Python, code blocks are defined by indentation rather than curly braces or other delimiters used in other programming languages. Here are a few examples of code blocks in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Function definition block: A block of code that defines a function in Python. It starts with the \"def\" keyword, followed by the function name and any parameters in parentheses, and ends with a colon. The body of the function is indented after the colon. For example:\n",

    "    z = x + y\n",
    "    return z\n",

    "2.If-else block: A block of code that checks a condition and executes different code depending on whether the condition is true or false. It starts with the \"if\" keyword, followed by the condition in parentheses, and ends with a colon. The code to be executed if the condition is true is indented after the colon. An optional \"else\" block can be added to execute code if the condition is false. For example:\n",

    "    \n",
    "3.Loop block: A block of code that iterates over a sequence of values and executes a block of code for each value. There are two main types of loops in Python: \"for\" loops and \"while\" loops. Both start with the loop keyword, followed by a variable to iterate over (for \"for\" loops) or a condition to check (for \"while\" loops), and end with a colon. The code to be executed for each iteration is indented after the colon. For example:\n",

    "\n",
    "ans-Memory management in Python is handled by the Python runtime using a combination of automatic memory allocation and garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a Python program is executed, the Python interpreter automatically allocates memory for the program's variables, objects, and data structures as needed. This memory is automatically freed when the objects are no longer needed or when the program terminates.\n",

    "Python uses a technique called reference counting to keep track of when objects are no longer needed. Each object in Python has a reference count, which is incremented each time the object is referenced by another part of the program. When the reference count of an object drops to zero, it is no longer needed and its memory is automatically freed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to reference counting, Python also employs a garbage collector to clean up circular references, which can occur when two or more objects reference each other in a circular chain. The garbage collector periodically scans the program's memory to identify and free any circular references that are no longer needed.\n",
